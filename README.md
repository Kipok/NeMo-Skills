# NeMo Skills

In this repository we provide pipelines to improve "skills" of large language models (LLMs).
Currently we focus on the ability to solve mathematical problems, but you can use our pipelines for many other tasks as well.

TBD

## Getting started

Try to [run inference with our models](/docs/inference.md) with just a few commands!

We provide all instructions to [fully reproduce our results](/docs/reproducing-results.md).

If you want to improve your own models or to learn more about our pipeline, read through the relevant docs below.

- [Generating synthetic data](/docs/synthetic-data-generation.md)
- [Training models](/docs/training.md)
- [Evaluating models](/docs/evaluation.md)

We also provide a convinient [tool](/nemo_inspector/Readme.md) for visualizing inference and data analysis
