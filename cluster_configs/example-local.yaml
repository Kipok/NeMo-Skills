# add required mounts for models/data here
# the code is mounted automatically inside /nemo_run/code
# but please note that we only package what's tracked by git + jsonl files inside nemo_skills/dataset

# mounts:
# you can define as many as you need, e.g.
#   - /mnt/datadrive/models:/models
#   - /mnt/datadrive/data:/data
#   - /home/<username>/workspace:/workspace
