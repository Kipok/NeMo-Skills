{"generation": "We have $225 = 5^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^0$.\n\nStarting with the smallest prime and writing the corresponding exponent, the number $225$ in base prime is $\\boxed{220}$.\n\n   Remark: The actual answer will depend on the definition of a \"correct\" representation.\n   In the most common case the answer is considered as 220, in other cases it might be written as 0220, where zero is explicitly shown. Both representations are correct and might be considered as the right answer depending on how you need to represent the base prime, either omitting all leading zeros or omitting all, except one leading zero. Please consult a particular book or a paper to see what representation is used there. Sometimes this is not explicitly stated but might be seen from the examples of the base prime representation.   Note that according to another definition of the base prime representation, the answer will be different for any number.   Another definition of the base prime can include only odd primes as places in the base prime representation. According to that definition, since $225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$, $225$ is written as $22$. But to keep both definitions distinguishable let us call this definition \"odd base prime\". We intentionally did not specify the name of the base prime definition used in this problem because this definition was not explicitly named in the statement of the problem.   In conclusion, all representations \"220\", \"0220\", and \"22\" are the right representations of 225 in different base prime systems.
