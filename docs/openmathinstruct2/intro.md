# How to reproduce our results

Make sure to complete [prerequisites](/docs/prerequisites.md).

If you want to reproduce results for [OpenMathInstruct-1: A 1.8 Million Math Instruction Tuning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10176)
please check out [v0.1.1](https://github.com/Kipok/NeMo-Skills/blob/v0.1.1/docs/reproducing-results.md)
branch of the repository and read the instructions in there.

Below are the instructions for reproducing
[OpenMathInstruct-2: Accelerating AI for Math with Massive Open-Source Instruction Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560).

Please note that unless you have an access to a large GPU cluster, it might take a very long time
for some of the commands to complete!
