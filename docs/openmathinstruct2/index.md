# How to reproduce our results

This section has instructions for reproducing
[OpenMathInstruct-2: Accelerating AI for Math with Massive Open-Source Instruction Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01560).

Please note that unless you have an access to a large GPU cluster, it might take a very long time
for some of the commands to complete!

- [Model evaluation](evaluation.md)
- [Dataset construction](dataset.md)
- [Model training](training.md)

!!! note

    If you want to reproduce results for [OpenMathInstruct-1: A 1.8 Million Math Instruction Tuning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10176)
    please check out [v0.1.1](https://github.com/Kipok/NeMo-Skills/blob/v0.1.1/docs/reproducing-results.md)
    branch of the [NeMo-Skills](https://github.com/Kipok/NeMo-Skills) repo and read the instructions in there.
