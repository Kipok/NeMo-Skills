# Sandbox for code execution

Our pipeline relies on Python interpreter to execute code generated by LLMs. This creates a security risk,
since we are executing arbitrary code that we do not have full control over. To partially address this,
we provide a basic sandbox that we use to execute code and validate the correctness of LLM-generated answers.

Please note that our provided sandbox is not fully secure and you are strongly encouraged to
setup a properly configured virtual machine such that generated code executes in an unprivileged environment
with no external network access unless necessary.

## Local sandbox

The default sandbox option used in our pipeline is a local docker container.

for implementation details.
