    You will be asked to look at the two answers (predicted and expected) to a math problem and to judge whether they are equivalent.

    The predicted answer is generated by a large language model, whereas the expected answer is the reference answer.

    Do not solve the question! Rather, determine if the predicted answer and the expected answer represent the same thing
    within the context of the question, regardless of the accuracy of the answers.

    You can use Python (with sympy library) to help evaluate the expressions if needed.

    Please first explain your rationale in a couple of sentences.
    Then respond with only Yes or No as your judgement on whether the two answers are the same.


    Question: Factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$.
    Predicted answer: $7x(x - 2)(x - 1)$
    Expected answer: $7x(x-1)(x-2)$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Both predicted and expected answers consists of the same 3 terms, only the order is different. Thus they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A rectangle has a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters.
    If the length is reduced by 3 meters and the width is halved, what is the new area of the rectangle in square meters?
    Predicted answer: 3/2
    Expected answer: 1.5<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's use Python to check whether the two expressions are equivalent.

    <|python_tag|>import math
    print(math.isclose(3/2, 1.5))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    True<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A rectangle has a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters. If the length is reduced by 3 meters and the width is halved, what is the new area of the rectangle in square meters?
    Predicted answer: 3245/5
    Expected answer: 649<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The question implies that the answer should be simplified if possible.
    Since the predicted answer contains a fraction that can be simplified further, we shouldn't consider these expressions equivalent.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Simplify the expression $\sqrt{{7!}}$, where $n!$ stands for $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots \cdot 2\cdot 1$.
    Predicted answer: 71
    Expected answer: 12\sqrt{{35}}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's evaluate 12\sqrt{{35}} using Python.

    <|python_tag|>import math
    print(12 * math.sqrt(35))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    70.9929573971954<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    This is close to 71, but not exactly the same. Since the question asks for the simplified form, we should consider them different.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Find the sum of $2_9 and 6_9$, Express your answer in base $9.$
    Predicted answer:  8_9
    Expected answer: 8<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The expected answer omits the base notation, but the values are the same. Thus, they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question:  A company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\%$ without altering the volume, by what percent must the height be decreased?
    Predicted answer:  36\%
    Expected answer: 36.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The expected answer omits the percentage symbol, but the values are the same. Thus, they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: What is the result of expanding and simplifying the square of the binomial (y + 1)^2
    Predicted answer:  $x^2+2x+1$
    Expected answer: $y^2+2y+1$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The predicted answer is written with $x$ as the variable, while the expected answer uses $y$ as the variable. Therefore, they are not the same in the context of the question.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A quadratic function f(x) has its vertex at the point (−1,0) and passes through the point (0,1). Determine the quadratic function f(x).
    Predicted answer: $x^2+2x+1$
    Expected answer: $(x+1)^2$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's use sympy to check whether the two expressions are equivalent.

    <|python_tag|>from sympy import symbols, simplify
    x = symbols('x')
    predicted_answer = x**2 + 2*x + 1
    expected_answer = (x + 1)**2
    print(simplify(predicted_answer - expected_answer))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A company tracks its annual revenue using a specific formula over a 10-year period. The revenue R(n) for year n is modeled by the polynomial R(n)=20000000−6006*n+10n^2, where n represents the number of years since the year 2010. Calculate the revenue for the year 2014.
    Predicted answer: 19941994
    Expected answer: 19941989<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The two numbers are very close, but they are not the same. Since the question asks for an exact number, we should consider them different.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Reduce to a form convenient for taking logarithms: $1-\frac{{1}}{{4}}\sin ^2 2\alpha -\sin ^2 \beta -\cos ^4 \alpha $
    Predicted answer: \sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)
    Expected answer: \sin(\alpha +\beta )\sin(\alpha -\beta)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The question asks to reduce the expression to a form convenient for taking logarithms.
    The expected answer is factorized into a product of two terms, which is more convenient for taking logarithms than a non-factorized expression.
    Since predicted answer is non-factorized, we should consider the two expressions different.

    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Simplify the following expressions: $\left(\frac{{15}}{{\sqrt 6+1}}+\frac{{4}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}-\frac{{12}}{{3-\sqrt 6}}\right) \left(\sqrt 6+11\right)$
    Predicted answer:  -171 - 26\sqrt 6 + \frac{{4\sqrt 6 + 44}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}
    Expected answer:  -115<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    It's possible to simplify this expression to an integer -115 as indicated by the expected answer. The predicted answer is not simplified to an integer, so we should consider them different.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
