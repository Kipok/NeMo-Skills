    You will be asked to look at the two answers (predicted and expected) to a math problem and to judge whether they are equivalent.

    The predicted answer is generated by a large language model, whereas the expected answer is the reference answer.

    Do not solve the question! Rather, determine if the predicted answer and the expected answer represent the same thing
    within the context of the question, regardless of the accuracy of the answers.

    You can use Python (with sympy library) to help evaluate the expressions if needed.

    Please first explain your rationale in a couple of sentences, then respond with only Yes or No as your judgement on whether they are the same.


    Question: Factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$.
    Predicted answer: $7x(x - 2)(x - 1)$
    Expected answer: $7x(x-1)(x-2)$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Both predicted and expected answers consists of the same 3 terms, only the order is different. Thus they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A rectangle has a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters.
    If the length is reduced by 3 meters and the width is halved, what is the new area of the rectangle in square meters?
    Predicted Answer: 3/2
    Expected Answer: 1.5<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's use Python to check whether the two expressions are equivalent.
    <|python_tag|>import math
    print(math.isclose(3/2, 1.5))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    True<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A rectangle has a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters. If the length is reduced by 3 meters and the width is halved, what is the new area of the rectangle in square meters?
    Predicted Answer: 3245/5
    Expected Answer: 649<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The question implies that the answer should be simplified if possible.
    Since the predicted answer contains a fraction that can be simplified further, we shouldn't consider these expressions equivalent.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Simplify the expression $\sqrt{{7!}}$, where $n!$ stands for $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots \cdot 2\cdot 1$.
    Predicted Answer: 71
    Expected Answer: 12\sqrt{{35}}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's evaluate 12\sqrt{{35}} using Python.
    <|python_tag|>import math
    print(12 * math.sqrt(35))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    70.9929573971954<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    This is close to 71, but not exactly the same. Since the question asks for the simplified form, we should consider them different.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: Find the sum of $2_9 and 6_9$, Express your answer in base $9.$
    Predicted Answer:  8_9
    Expected Answer: 8<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The expected answer omits the base notation, but the values are the same. Thus, they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question:  A company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\%$ without altering the volume, by what percent must the height be decreased?
    Predicted Answer:  36\%
    Expected Answer: 36.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The expected answer omits the percentage symbol, but the values are the same. Thus, they are equivalent.
    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: What is the result of expanding and simplifying the square of the binomial (y + 1)^2
    Predicted Answer:  $x^2+2x+1$
    Expected Answer: $y^2+2y+1$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The predicted answer is written with $x$ as the variable, while the expected answer uses $y$ as the variable. Therefore, they are not the same in the context of the question.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A quadratic function f(x) has its vertex at the point (−1,0) and passes through the point (0,1). Determine the quadratic function f(x).
    Predicted Answer: $x^2+2x+1$
    Expected Answer: $(x+1)^2$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Let's use sympy to check whether the two expressions are equivalent.
    <|python_tag|>from sympy import symbols, simplify
    x = symbols('x')
    predicted_answer = x**2 + 2*x + 1
    expected_answer = (x + 1)**2
    print(simplify(predicted_answer - expected_answer))<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

    0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Judgement: Yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Question: A company tracks its annual revenue using a specific formula over a 10-year period. The revenue R(n) for year n is modeled by the polynomial R(n)=20000000−6006*n+10n^2, where n represents the number of years since the year 2010. Calculate the revenue for the year 2014.
    Predicted Answer: 19941994
    Expected answer: 19941989<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    The two numbers are very close, but they are not the same. Since the question asks for an exact number, we should consider them different.
    Judgement: No<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

# Example 10:
# Question: A line segment of length $5$ has one endpoint at $(1, 2)$ and the other endpoint at $(4, b)$. Find all possible values of $b$, separated by commas.
# Predicted Answer:  -2, 6
# Expected Answer: 6, -2

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as false that the Predicted Answer, $-2, 6$, and the Expected Answer, $6, -2$, are the same.
# Rationale: Predicted Answer, $-2, 6$, and Expected Answer,  $6, -2$, represent the same set of possible values for $b$, just listed in a different order. The order in which the values are listed does not change the set of solutions.
# Yes

# Example 11:
# Question: A regular pentagon is a five-sided polygon with all sides and interior angles equal. What is the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon?
# Predicted Answer: 72
# Expected Answer: 72 degrees

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer, $72$, and the Expected Answer, $72 degrees$, are the same.
# Rationale: The Predicted Answer, 72, and the Expected Answer, 72 degress, are the same in the context of the question, as they both indicate the same thing for the interior angle.
# Yes

# Example 12:
# Question: Solve $\tan x = \sin x$ for $0 \le x \le 2 \pi.$  Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.
# Predicted Answer: 0, \pi
# Expected Answer: 0,\pi,2\pi.

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer, $0, \pi $, and the Expected Answer, $0,\pi,2\pi$, are the same.
# Rationale: The expressions are not equivalent because $2\pi$ is an additional solution in Expected Answer that is not present in Predicted Answer. In the context of the question, each answer lists distinct sets of solutions within the given interval.
# No

# Example 13:
# Question: Expand the following product: $\frac{{1}}{{4}}\left(\frac{{4}}{{y}} + 4y\right)$.
# Predicted Answer: \frac{{1 + y^2}}{{y}}
# Expected Answer: \frac{{1}}{{y}}+y.

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer, $\frac{{1 + y^2}}{{y}}$, and the Expected Answer, $\frac{{1}}{{y}}+y$, are the same.
# Rationale: Predicted Answer, $\frac{{1 + y^2}}{{y}}$, is simplified as \[\frac{{1 + y^2}}{{y}} = \frac{{1}}{{y}} + \frac{{y^2}}{{y}} = \frac{{1}}{{y}} + y\] which is equivalent to the Expected Answer, $\frac{{1}}{{y}} + y$.
# Yes


# Example 14:
# Question: Find the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers, such that $1 \le a,$ $b,$ $c \le 100,$ and \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc.\]
# Predicted Answer: 1
# Expected Answer: 100

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer, $1$, and the Expected Answer, $100$, are the same.
# Rationale: The two answers represent different quantities; Predicted Answer suggests there is only one such triple, while Expected Answer suggests there are 100 such triples. They cannot both be correct in the context of the given question.
# No


# Example 15:
# Question: Let $z$ be a complex number such that \[z^3 + \frac{{1}}{{z^3}} = 52.\]Find all possible values of \[z + \frac{{1}}{{z}}.\]Enter all possible values, separated by commas.
# Predicted Answer: 4
# Expected Answer: 4,-2+3i,-2-3i.

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer, $4$, and the Expected Answer, $4,-2+3i,-2-3i$, are the same.
# Rationale: Predicted answer and Expected answer do not represent the same thing. Predicted answer lists a single real number as a possible value, while Expected answer lists three distinct values, including two complex numbers. In the context of the question, these answers are suggesting different sets of solutions for the given equation.
# No


# Example 16:
# Question: The curve parameterized by $(x,y) = (2t + 5, 12t^2 - 8t - 7)$ is a parabola, where $t$ is a real number.  Find the equation of the parabola.  Enter the equation in the form "$y = ax^2 + bx + c$".
# Predicted Answer:  3x^2 - 34x + 88
# Expected Answer:  y=3x^2-34x+88.

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as false that the Predicted Answer, $4$, and the Expected Answer, $4,-2+3i,-2-3i$, are the same.
# Rationale:  Predicted answer and Expected answer represent the same thing in the context of the question, as they both describe a quadratic equation in the form "y = ax^2 + bx + c". The only difference is that Expected Answer explicitly includes the variable y on the left side, which is understood to be there in predicted Answer.
# Yes



# Example 17:
# Question: The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7.$  Find the range of the function $h(x).$
# Predicted Answer:   -13, 3
# Expected Answer:   [-13,3]

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as false that the Predicted Answer $-13, 3$, and the Expected Answer, $[-13,3]$, are the same.
# Rationale:  Predicted Answer and Expected Answer represent the same thing in the context of the question, as they both describe a closed interval from -13 to 3. The use of parentheses or brackets is often interchangeable in informal contexts when describing intervals, although technically brackets denote inclusion of the endpoints in mathematical notation.
# Yes


# Example 18:
# Question: How many terms of the sequence $\sqrt{{1}},\sqrt{{2}},\sqrt{{3}},\sqrt{{4}},\ldots$ are less than or equal to $20$?
# Predicted Answer:   4
# Expected Answer:   400

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer $-13, 3$, and the Expected Answer, $[-13,3]$, are the same.
# Rationale:  Predicted Answer and Expected Answer do not represent the same thing in the context of the question because they are numerically different values, and there is no trivial simplification or conversion that would make the number of terms 4 equivalent to 400.
# No



# Example 19:
# Question: Reduce to a form convenient for taking logarithms: $1-\frac{{1}}{{4}}\sin ^2 2\alpha -\sin ^2 \beta -\cos ^4 \alpha $
# Predicted Answer: \sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)
# Expected Answer:  \sin(\alpha +\beta )\sin(\alpha -\beta)

# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer $\sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)$, and the Expected Answer, $\sin(\alpha +\beta )\sin(\alpha -\beta)$, are the same.
# Rationale:  To simplify the Predicted Answer, \(\sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)\), we can use the difference of squares identity. The identity states:\[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\]
# In this case, we set \(a = \sin(\alpha)\) and \(b = \sin(\beta)\). Using the difference of squares identity, we have: \[\sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta) = (\sin(\alpha) - \sin(\beta))(\sin(\alpha) + \sin(\beta))], which is not the same the Expected Answer.
# No


# Example 20:
# Question: Simplify the following expressions: $\left(\frac{{15}}{{\sqrt 6+1}}+\frac{{4}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}-\frac{{12}}{{3-\sqrt 6}}\right) \left(\sqrt 6+11\right)$
# Predicted Answer:  -171 - 26\sqrt 6 + \frac{{4\sqrt 6 + 44}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}
# Expected Answer:  -115


# The symbolic expression comparison system judges as true that the Predicted Answer $-171 - 26\sqrt 6 + \frac{{4\sqrt 6 + 44}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}$, and the Expected Answer, $-115$, are the same.
# Rationale:  For Predicted Answer, $-171 - 26\sqrt 6 + \frac{{4\sqrt 6 + 44}}{{\sqrt 6-2}}$,
# we will first rationalize the denominator of the fractioncan:
# \[\frac{{(4\sqrt{{6}} + 44)(\sqrt{{6}} + 2)}}{{(\sqrt{{6}} - 2)(\sqrt{{6}} + 2)}}\]

# Then the denominator is a difference of squares: \[(\sqrt{{6}} - 2)(\sqrt{{6}} + 2) = (\sqrt{{6}})^2 - (2)^2 = 6 - 4 = 2\], then we expand the numerator as:
# \[(4\sqrt{{6}} + 44)(\sqrt{{6}} + 2) = 4\sqrt{{6}} \cdot \sqrt{{6}} + 4\sqrt{{6}} \cdot 2 + 44 \cdot \sqrt{{6}} + 44 \cdot 2\]
# \[= 4 \cdot 6 + 8\sqrt{{6}} + 44\sqrt{{6}} + 88\]
# \[= 24 + 52\sqrt{{6}} + 88\]
# \[= 112 + 52\sqrt{{6}}\]

# Now the fraction becomes:
# \[\frac{{112 + 52\sqrt{{6}}{{2}} = \frac{{112}}{{2}} + \frac{{52\sqrt{{6}}{{2}} = 56 + 26\sqrt{{6}}\]

# Substitute back into the original expression:
# \[-171 - 26\sqrt{{6}} + 56 + 26\sqrt{{6}}\]
# Combine like terms: \[-171 + 56 = -115\], Thus, the simplified expression is: $-15$, which is equivalent as Expected Answer.

# Yes
