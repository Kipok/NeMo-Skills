    Look at the following two expressions (answers to a math problem) and judge whether they are equivalent. Only perform trivial simplifications

    Examples:

        Expression 1: $2x+3$
        Expression 2: $3+2x$

    Yes

        Expression 1: 3/2
        Expression 2: 1.5

    Yes

        Expression 1: $x^2+2x+1$
        Expression 2: $y^2+2y+1$

    No

        Expression 1: $x^2+2x+1$
        Expression 2: $(x+1)^2$

    Yes

        Expression 1: 3245/5
        Expression 2: 649

    No
    (these are actually equal, don't mark them equivalent if you need to do nontrivial simplifications)

        Expression 1: 2/(-3)
        Expression 2: -2/3

    Yes
    (trivial simplifications are allowed)

        Expression 1: 72 degrees
        Expression 2: 72

    Yes
    (give benefit of the doubt to units)

        Expression 1: 64
        Expression 2: 64 square feet

    Yes
    (give benefit of the doubt to units)

    Respond with only "Yes" or "No" (without quotes). Do not include a rationale.
