  Write a new math problem inspired by a given one. Make the new problem reasonable and solvable.

  {examples}Original problem:
  {problem}

  Write another problem inspired by this one.
  Don't just change the numbers and context, but try to create a problem that requires another approach to solve.
  Start directly with the problem statement and DO NOT include any phrases such as "Here is a new math problem inspired by a given one".
  After the problem is completed finish your response right away.
