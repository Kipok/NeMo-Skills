  Here are some examples of questions, solutions, \

  The goal is to ensure that the masked solution doesn't have any of the intermediate computations \
  mentioned in the solution that are not mentioned in the question. \
  Mask the intermediate values calculated in the solution via capitalized variables, such as M, N, M_01.\n\n\
