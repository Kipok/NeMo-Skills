From the question we know that points $(-1, -11)$ and $(3, 17)$ lie on the parabola. This means that when we substitute $x$ and $y$ from these points into the equation $y = x^2 + bx + c$, the equation must hold true. We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$.

For the point $(-1, -11)$:

Substitute $x = -1$ and $ y = -11 $ into the equation:
\\[ -11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\Rightarrow -11 = 1 - b + c \\Rightarrow -b + c = -12 \\]

For the point $(3, 17)$:

Substitute $x = 3$ and $y = 17$ into the equation:
\\[ 17 = (3)^2 + b(3) + c \\Rightarrow 17 = 9 + 3b + c \\Rightarrow 3b + c = 8 \\]

In summary, we have the two equations

-b + c &= -12\\\\
3b + c &= 8

To solve for $c$ we can eliminate $b$ by multiplying the first equation by 3 and adding equations together.
Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $3(-b + c) = 3 (-12) \\Rightarrow -3b + 3c = -36$. Adding equations together gives us
\\[ (-3b + 3c) + (3b + c) = -36 + 8 \\Rightarrow -3b + 3b + 3c + c = -28 \\Rightarrow 4c = -28 \\Rightarrow c = -28 : 4 \\Rightarrow c = \\boxed{-7} \\]

To determine whether $f(f(x))$ is even, odd, or neither, we need to use the property of $f(x)$ being an odd function.

An odd function is defined as:
\\[ f(-x) = -f(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\]

Given that $f(x)$ is odd, let's find $f(f(-x))$ and see how it relates to $f(f(x))$.

1. Substitute $-x$ into the function $f(x)$:
\\[ f(-x) \\]

2. Since $f(x)$ is odd, apply the definition of an odd function:
\\[ f(-x) = -f(x) \\]

3. Now substitute $-f(x)$ into the function $f$:
\\[ f(f(-x)) = f(-f(x)) \\]

4. Again, using the fact that $f(x)$ is odd, apply the definition:
\\[ f(-f(x)) = -f(f(x)) \\]

5. We have found that:
\\[ f(f(-x)) = -f(f(x)) \\]

This matches the definition of an odd function.

There are a total of six columns in the graph with values: 2, 3, 6, 4, 3, and 1.
Since Aaron ate the most apples, and Zeb ate the fewest apples, we can answer the question using the following Python code.

apple_count = [2, 3, 6, 4, 3, 1]

# Aaron apple count
aaron_apple = max(apple_count)

To calculate these perfect cubes between 100 and 900, there are a few ways.
One way is to enumerate cubes, and calculate the ones which satisfy this constraint.

To solve the problem using the latter strategy, we use the following Python code.

Let each side of the square be 1. So the area of ABCD is 1^2=1.
The triangle AMN, has base of length AM=1/2, and height of length of 1/2 as well since BN=1/2.
Hence, area of AMN = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.
