From the question we know that points $(-1, -11)$ and $(3, 17)$ lie on the parabola. This means that when we substitute $x$ and $y$ from these points into the equation $y = x^2 + bx + c$, the equation must hold true. We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$.

For the point $(-1, -11)$:

Substitute $x = -1$ and $ y = -11 $ into the equation:
\\[ -11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\Rightarrow -11 = 1 - b + c \\Rightarrow -b + c = -12 \\]

For the point $(3, 17)$:

Substitute $x = 3$ and $y = 17$ into the equation:
\\[ 17 = (3)^2 + b(3) + c \\Rightarrow 17 = 9 + 3b + c \\Rightarrow 3b + c = 8 \\]

In summary, we have the two equations

-b + c &= -12\\\\
3b + c &= 8

To solve for $c$ we can eliminate $b$ by multiplying the first equation by 3 and adding equations together.
Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $3(-b + c) = 3 (-12) \\Rightarrow -3b + 3c = -36$. Adding equations together gives us

To determine whether $f(f(x))$ is even, odd, or neither, we need to use the property of $f(x)$ being an odd function.

An odd function is defined as:
\\[ f(-x) = -f(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\]

Given that $f(x)$ is odd, let's find $f(f(-x))$ and see how it relates to $f(f(x))$.

1. Substitute $-x$ into the function $f(x)$:
\\[ f(-x) \\]

2. Since $f(x)$ is odd, apply the definition of an odd function:
\\[ f(-x) = -f(x) \\]

3. Now substitute $-f(x)$ into the function $f$:
\\[ f(f(-x)) = f(-f(x)) \\]

4. Again, using the fact that $f(x)$ is odd, apply the definition:
\\[ f(-f(x)) = -f(f(x)) \\]

5. We have found that:
\\[ f(f(-x)) = -f(f(x)) \\]

This matches the definition of an odd function.

To calculate these perfect cubes between 100 and 900, there are a few ways.
One way is to enumerate cubes, and calculate the ones which satisfy this constraint.
Another is to just take cube roots of the interval endpoints, with ceil and floor fns applied to start and end of the boundary.
To solve the problem using the latter strategy, we use the following Python code.
{code_begin}
import math

lower_val = int(math.ceil(100**(1/3)))
higher_val = int(math.floor(900**(1/3)))

num_perfect_cubes = higher_val - lower_val + 1

Let each side of the square be 1. So the area of ABCD is 1^2=1.
The triangle AMN, has base of length AM=1/2, and height of length of 1/2 as well since BN=1/2.
Hence, area of AMN = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.
Hence. ratio of area of AMN to ABCD is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.
